Computer Vision Final Project - implements pitch classification using video classification NN and provides an implementation of ball detection in a time series of frames.


All files were in a shared google drive and primarily worked on using Colab. The files were moved to GitHub after the project was completed, which is why there are only a few large commits from one group member.
